The .well-known folder is a standardized directory on a web server that stores site-wide metadata for various web protocols and security purposes. It is most commonly used to verify domain ownership for an SSL certificate by holding a validation file, but it also stores other important information, such as security policies and service discovery information. 
Key functions of the .well-known folder
SSL Certificate Verification: When ordering an SSL certificate, you may be required to create a .well-known directory in your website's root folder and upload a specific text file to it. A certificate authority (CA) will then check for the file at a specific URL to verify your ownership of the domain.
Metadata and Service Discovery: The folder acts as a standardized location for web-based protocols to find site-wide information before making a request. This can include information about security policies, such as the Robots Exclusion Protocol, and other service-related metadata.
Security and Authentication: It serves as an endpoint for authentication and can store security policy files.
Third-party Integrations: It provides a reliable interface for third-party services to access necessary configuration or information about your site.
